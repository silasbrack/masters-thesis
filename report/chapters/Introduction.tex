\section{The problem}

\subsection{What is the problem?}
\cite{Widom2006TipsPapers}

\subsection{Why is it interesting and important? (Motivation)}



\section{Current state of research in the area}

\subsection{Why is it hard? (E.g. why do naïve approaches fail?)}

\subsection{Why hasn’t it been solved before? (Or, what’s wrong with previous proposed solutions?)}

\section{My solution}

\subsection{How does my solution differ?}
The ideas presented in this article essentially constitute a compilation of advice given by academics from multiple fields and institutions,

\subsection{What are the key components of my approach and results? Are there any specific limitations?}

\section{Research objectives}

\subsection{What are the goals for this project?}
This should be discussed in a bit more detail in a thesis, since there are certain objectives discussed in the project plan.
In an article, a quick sentence which summarises the rest of the introduction and states succinctly exactly which problem will be tackled and which approach will be made should suffice.
